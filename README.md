## Getting Started
Syncs Kindle Scribe notebooks using an android user agent to access the notebook files. 
Keeps a local record of the last update time. Runs a check every 5 minutes.
Stores the files in a destination folder in PDF format.

Using `pystray` to have a "Force Sync" and "Last Update" button in the system tray.

This is currently only made for running on windows. 
You must authenticate through the selenium browser, 2 min timeout when it opens.
The cookies are then saved for use later by requests.

There may be some bugs. Not sure how much I will maintain it.
No Longer have a Kindle Scribe to test with.
